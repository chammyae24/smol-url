## Description

A basic URL shortener application built with Supabase and Bun.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

## Setup

### 1. Start Supabase

Run the following command to start Supabase locally:

```bash
supabase start
```

This will start the Supabase services.

### 2. Start the Server

Navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

Then, start the server using Bun:

```bash
bun start
```

### 3. Start the Client

Open a new terminal tab and navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Now, start the client with the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the client application in development mode.

## Environment Variables

Ensure you have the correct environment variables set up for both the server and client. You may need to configure your `.env` files for proper operation.
